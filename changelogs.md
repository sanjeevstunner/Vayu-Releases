# Notes [Must Read]

 - Bug report without logs is useless
 - No support will be provided for ROMs with custom kernels installed
 - Flashing  magisk is fine, but try reporting bugs once you're sure its not caused due to some module you installed [Don't be a retarded]
 - Ask anything in my group [here](https://t.me/chandeler_s_chat)
